Hi! I need you to test the new email notification and user management features that were just added to this Excel Insights Dashboard application.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Flask app with Claude Agent SDK for Excel analysis
- PostgreSQL database with user authentication
- RTL Hebrew UI with guest mode support
- Recently added: Email notifications via SendGrid, XML user config, admin panel enhancements

YOUR TASKS:

1. READ THE TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
   - Open and read: TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - This contains all 10 test tasks with detailed steps

2. USE PLAYWRIGHT MCP FOR UI TESTING
   - Playwright MCP server is installed and configured globally
   - Use it to automate browser testing, take screenshots, and verify UI behavior
   - Test scenarios are described in the instructions document

3. TEST THESE KEY FEATURES:
   ✅ Database schema has email fields (email, email_notifications)
   ✅ users.xml loads successfully with XML parsing
   ✅ Admin panel shows email column and can add/edit user emails
   ✅ Email notification checkbox appears for logged-in users (NOT for guests)
   ✅ Email service module is properly integrated
   ✅ Upload flow captures email preference correctly
   ✅ Email templates are formatted in RTL Hebrew

4. TESTING APPROACH:
   - Follow tasks 1-10 in TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Use Playwright MCP for automated UI testing where possible
   - Take screenshots to document UI changes
   - Verify both happy paths and edge cases
   - Test guest mode vs logged-in user behavior

5. IMPORTANT NOTES:
   - DO NOT try to send actual emails (no SendGrid API key configured yet)
   - DO verify code paths reach email sending logic
   - DO test graceful fallback when API key missing
   - DO check RTL Hebrew layout and styling

6. DELIVERABLES:
   - Test results summary (Pass/Fail for each task)
   - Screenshots from Playwright automation
   - Any issues or bugs found
   - Recommendations for improvements

RECENT CHANGES (for context):
- Last session completed Part 1 and Part 2 of email notification feature
- Migrated from users.yaml to users.xml configuration
- Added email_service.py with SendGrid integration
- Modified: app.py, database.py, auth.py, templates/admin.html, templates/index.html
